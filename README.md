# Cas12a-gRNA-on-target-and-off-target-design
This Python script is crafted for the purpose of designing guide RNAs (gRNAs) for the CRISPR-Cas12a system, focusing on both on-target and off-target gRNA creation. 
It features two main functions: one for on-target gRNA design using specific gene information, and another for off-target gRNA design using gene information from a different strain with a mismatch threshold exceeding three. 
The script also includes a module for controlling the CG content of the gRNAs.
